# Estridge-Final-Project
All of the code and files needed to run the project can be located on this git hub page. I used jupyter notebook to make my python files. nfl.xlsx is the excell file that contains the training data from the 2016 NFL season. nfl_2021.xlsx contains the testing data from the 2021 nfl season. Blender.ipynb is the python file that contains the code to create the blender and to test it on the 2021 dataset. All of the files ending in .sav are the models that have been saved. Each python file that has the name of a machine learning algorithm is the code that trained that particular model. Currently I have commented out the line of code to save the model because I want the models to stay as they are. All of the files will need to be in the same directory as Blender.ipynb for the code to execute.
